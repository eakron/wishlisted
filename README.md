# wishlisted

Simple application using Clojure, Noir, ClojureScript, Jayq, Fetch, Crate and Korma to handle easy creation and sharing of wishlists in the browser. Depends on the PostgreSQL database.

On the design side all CSS is compiled using SASS. It also borrows some features from Twitter Bootstrap.

We've made the source code available, partly to be used as an example for building web applications using Clojure and partly to demonstrate how powerful the Clojure ecosystem already is, enabling us to build versatile applications (including JavaScript, SQL) without ever having to leave the wonderful world of Lisp. Hopefully it will inspire others to try it out, make amazing things and help the community grow!
